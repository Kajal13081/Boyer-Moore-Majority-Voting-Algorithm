# Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm

The Boyer-Moore voting algorithm is one of the popular optimal algorithms which is used to find the majority element among the given elements that have more than N/ 2 occurrences. This algorithm works on the fact that if an element occurs more than N/2 times, it means that the remaining elements other than this would definitely be less than N/2.

This works perfectly fine for finding the majority element which takes exactly 2 traversals over the given elements, which works in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
It's also quite simple to implement, though a little trickier to understand how it works.
